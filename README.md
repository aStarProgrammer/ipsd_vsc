# IPSD (vsc version)
IPSD(Inter Planet Site Watchdog) is a tool to work with IPSC and create static html site automatically.

## Background

IPFS (Inter Planet File System [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) is a peer-to-peer hyperlink protocol which is used to publish content. We can publish a web site  on IPFS as we publish a site on http.

But as IPFS is an p2p system, file published on IPFS cannot be changed, if we changed a file and publish to IPFS again, it is a completely new file from the old one.  Changing files of a IPFS file is not encouraged. So generally sites that are built on ASP.NET Java PHP which have a lot of scripts are not the best option when you want to publish a site to IPFS. Static website based on HTML and CSS is the best option.

IPSC is the tool to create static html site that you can publish to IPFS.

IPSD work with IPSC to create site automatically.



**NOTE:**

This version of ipsd is used for visual studio code extension, its name is ipsd_vsc, it is almost the same with ispd except the method to add meta data of markdown and html source file.
